You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I've learned some new tags such as `<strike>` and also learned how to guess
font-family. It's "easy but not very easy", because making it looking "exactly" like
the mockup image requires attention to details but still interseting. I refer the MDN HTML
document to solve the problem.
